        # --- Example Implementation Ideas ---

        # 1. Email Notification (using Flask-Mail or similar)
        # if notification_type == 'email':
        #     try:
        #         mail = Mail(current_app) # Assuming Flask-Mail is initialized elsewhere
        #         msg = Message(subject,
        #                       sender=current_app.config.get('MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER'),
        #                       recipients=[recipient])
        #         msg.body = message
        #         # For production, sending email should typically be done asynchronously
        #         # to avoid blocking the web server. Use Celery for this.
        #         # send_email_task.delay(msg) # Example using a Celery task
        #         # mail.send(msg) # Synchronous sending (use with caution in web requests)
        #         print(f"Email simulation sent to {recipient}") # In simulation
        #     except Exception as e:
        #         current_app.logger.error(f"Failed to send email to {recipient}: {e}")
        #         # Handle errors (e.g., log, retry later)
        #         pass # Continue processing or raise exception

        # 2. SMS Notification (using Twilio, Vonage, etc.)
        # if notification_type == 'sms':
        #     try:
        #         # Example using a hypothetical sms_client
        #         # sms_client.send(to=recipient, body=message)
        #         # Like email, SMS sending can be slow, consider using Celery.
        #         # send_sms_task.delay(recipient, message) # Example using a Celery task
        #         print(f"SMS simulation sent to {recipient}") # In simulation
        #     except Exception as e:
        #         current_app.logger.error(f"Failed to send SMS to {recipient}: {e}")
        #         # Handle errors
        #         pass

        # 3. In-App Notification
        # if notification_type == 'in-app':
        #     try:
        #         # Example: Create a new InAppNotification record in the database
        #         # from app.models.notification import InAppNotification # Assuming this model exists
        #         # new_notification = InAppNotification(recipient_user_id=get_user_id_from_recipient(recipient),
        #         #                                      subject=subject,
        #         #                                      message=message,
        #         #                                      tenant_id=get_tenant_id_from_recipient(recipient) # Important for multi-tenant
        #         #                                     )
        #         # db.session.add(new_notification)
        #         # db.session.commit()
        #         print(f"In-App notification simulation created for {recipient}") # In simulation
        #     except Exception as e:
        #         current_app.logger.error(f"Failed to create in-app notification for {recipient}: {e}")
        #         # Handle errors
        #         pass

        # 4. Using Celery for Asynchronous Sending
        # For production, it's highly recommended to move the actual sending logic
        # into Celery tasks to avoid blocking your main application processes.
        # Example of how you might call a Celery task (task implementation needed elsewhere):
        # if notification_type == 'email':
        #    from app.tasks import send_email_task # Assuming tasks are defined in app/tasks.py
        #    send_email_task.delay(recipient, subject, message)
        # elif notification_type == 'sms':
        #    from app.tasks import send_sms_task
        #    send_sms_task.delay(recipient, message)
        # ... and so on for other types.

        # The 'pass' statement is kept here as a final fallback if no specific
        # notification_type matches or if simulation is intended.
        pass

# Helper functions (might be needed depending on implementation)
# def get_user_id_from_recipient(recipient):
#     # Logic to find user ID based on recipient (e.g., email)
#     pass

# def get_tenant_id_from_recipient(recipient):
#      # Logic to find tenant ID based on recipient or user
#      pass
